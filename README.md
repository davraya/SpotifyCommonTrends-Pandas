# Overview

For this small project I was just trying to learn a Python library called Pandas. To accomplish this I downloaded a [csv file](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/estienneggx/spotify-unpopular-songs) with over 10,000 songs of the most unpoular songs in Spotify. I tought it will be fun to find the most common characteristics of unpopular songs.

# Data Analysis Results

What are are the most common trends ammong unpopular songs?
Do people tend to not like loud music?
Do people like energetic music?

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as my IDE to develop this program. As my version control system I like to use git. Like I mentioned before the library that I used for this project is Pandas, which is built on top of Numpy.

# Useful Websites

This are the website that I used to learn how to use Pandas.
* [Pandas Series Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.html)
* [Pandas DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html)

# Future Work

Thing to work keep on working in 
* Find the most common range of values for the rest of the attributes.
* Find the most common combination of attributes.
